 
Actually using “sockets” module make processes synchronous (like it breaks all the going works during it’s working ) but we need to be done asynchronously so we use “websockets” module.
 
Websockets is a library for building websocket servers and clients in python which is built on top of “asyncio” a python’s standard asynchronous I/O framework.

Basic Example
WebSocket server example.
It reads a name from the client, sends a greeting, and closes the connection.

//
import asyncio
import websockets


async def hello(websocket, path):

   name = await websocket.recv()
    print(f"< {name}")

    greeting = f"Hello {name}!"

    await websocket.send(greeting)
    print(f"> {greeting}")


start_server = websockets.serve(hello, "localhost", 8765)


asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(start_server)
asyncio.get_event_loop().run_forever()
//

On the server side, websockets executes the handler coroutine hello once for each WebSocket connection. It closes the connection when the handler coroutine returns.

//
import asyncio
import websockets

async def hello():
   uri = "ws://localhost:8765"
   async with websockets.connect(uri) as websocket:
       name = input("What's your name? ")

        await websocket.send(name)
        print(f"> {name}")

        greeting = await websocket.recv()
        print(f"< {greeting}")

asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(hello())
 //
 
Using connect() as an asynchronous context manager ensures the connection is closed before exiting the hello coroutine.
 
WebSocket is a computer communications transport protocol (like TCP, HTTP 1.0, HTTP etc.)
Socket is an endpoint for sending and receiving data across the network (like Port number).

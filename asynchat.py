#The asynchat module builds on asyncore to make it easier to implement protocols based on passing messages back and forth between server and client. 
#The async_chat class is an asyncore.dispatcher subclass that receives data and looks for a message terminator. 
#Your subclass only needs to specify what to do when data comes in and how to respond once the terminator is found. 
#Outgoing data is queued for transmission via FIFO objects managed by async_chat.


#The EchoServer example below uses both a simple string terminator and a message length terminator, depending on the context of the incoming data. 
#The HTTP request handler example in the standard library documentation offers another example of how to change the terminator based on the context to differentiate between HTTP headers and the HTTP POST request body.
